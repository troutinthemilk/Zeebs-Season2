abstract = {Well-known concepts in statistical inference and sampling theory are used to develop recommendations for planning and analyzing the results of quantitative surveys of freshwater mollusks. Two methods of inference commonly used in survey sampling (design-based and model-based) are described and illustrated using examples relevant in surveys of freshwater mollusks. The particular objectives of a survey and the type of information observed in each unit of sampling can be used to help select the sampling design and the method of inference. For example, the mean density of a sparsely distributed population of mollusks can be estimated with higher precision by using model-based inference or by using design-based inference with adaptive cluster sampling than by using design-based inference with conventional sampling. More experience with quantitative surveys of natural assemblages of freshwater mollusks is needed to determine the actual benefits of different sampling designs and inferential procedures.},

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in fully model-based methods. Model-based methods are less robust for estimating animal abundance than conventional methods, but offer several advantages: they allow the analyst to explore how animal density varies by habitat or topography; abundance can be estimated for any sub-region of interest; they provide tools for analysing data from designed distance sampling experiments, to assess treatment effects. We develop a common framework for model-based distance sampling, and show how the various model-based methods that have been proposed fit within this framework.},

abstract = {The ecological and economic impacts of the introduced zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas)) have been due in part to a life history that is conserved with marine bivalves but unique among the indigenous freshwater fauna. There are a number of life history events in D. polymorpha that follow external fertilization and embryology. The first is a brief trochophore stage. The development of a velum and secretion of a larval shell lead to a D-shaped veliger, which is the first recognizable planktonic larva. Later a second larval shell is secreted and this veliconcha is the last obligate free-swimming veliger. Conversely, the last larval stage, the pediveliger, can either swim using its velum or crawl using its foot. Pediveligers select substrates on which they "settle" by secreting byssal threads and undergo metamorphosis to become plantigrade mussels. The secretion of the adult shell and change in growth axis lead to the convergent heteromyarian shape. Zebra mussels produce byssal threads as adults, bu...},

abstract = {To determine trends in abundances, we conducted a survey of freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionidae) and zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha [Pallas, 1771]) at five sites in the northwestern portion of Lake St. Clair in 1997. Previous, more extensive spatial surveys between 1986 and 1994 showed that unionids were mostly eliminated from the lake as a result of zebra mussel infestation, but at least a few unionids; were still present in the northwestern portion in 1994. The 1994 survey also showed that zebra mussel densities were still increasing in this portion of the lake. In the present survey, no live unionids were collected despite a sampling effort modified from prior surveys specifically to locate live individuals. From these results, we believe that freshwater mussels have been eliminated from the open waters of Lake St. Clair. Zebra mussel populations appear to have reached a steady state in the northwest portion as evidenced by a decrease in mean! density from 2,247 m(-2) in 1994 to 1,237 m(-2) in 1997, and a decrease in the mean size of individuals in the population.

@article{Oedekoven2013,
abstract = {1. There is currently much interest in replacing the design-based component of conventional distance sampling methods by a modelling approach where animal densities are related to environmental covariates. These models allow identification of relationships between density and covariates. One of the uses of such models is to assess the effects of some intervention on numbers for species of conservation interest in designed distance sampling experiments. 2. In this context, we use an integrated likelihood approach for modelling sample counts, adopting a Poisson model and allowing imperfect detectability on the sample plots. We use the method of Royle, Dawson {\&} Bates (2004, Ecology, 85, 1591), extended to model heteroge- neity in detection probabilities using either multiple covariate distance sampling methods or stratification. Moreover, we include a random effect for site in the plot abundance model to accommodate correlation in repeat counts at a single site. 3. These developments were motivated by a large-scale experimental study to assess the effects of establishing conservation buffers along field margins on indigo buntings in several US states. We analyse the data using an integrated likelihood and include model selection for both the Poisson rate of counts and detection probabilities. We assess model performance by comparing our results with those using a two-stage approach (Buckland et al. 2009, Journal of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Statistics, 14, 432) which we extended by includ- ing a random effect for site in the plot abundance model. 4. The two methods led to the same selected models and gave similar results for parameters, which revealed significant beneficial effects of buffers on indigo bunting densities. Densities on buffered fields were on average 35{\%} higher than on unbuffered fields. Using a detection function stratified by state captured some of the heterogeneity in detection probabilities between the nine states included in the analyses. 5. Synthesis and applications. We develop and compare two methods for analysing data from large-scale distance sampling experiments with imbalanced repeat measures. By including a random site effect in the plot abundance model, we relax the assumption of independent sam- ple counts which is generally made for distance sampling methods, and we allow inference to be drawn for the wider region that the sites represent.},

abstract = {Distance sampling is a widely used method to estimate animal population size. Most distance sampling models utilize a monotonically decreasing detection function such as a half-normal. Recent advances in distance sampling modeling allow for the incorporation of covariates into the distance model, and the elimination of the assumption of perfect detection at some fixed distance (usually the transect line) with the use of double-observer models. The assumption of full observer independence in the double-observer model is problematic, but can be addressed by using the point independence assumption which assumes there is one distance, the apex of the detection function, where the 2 observers are assumed independent. Aerially collected distance sampling data can have a unimodal shape and have been successfully modeled with a gamma detection function. Covariates in gamma detection models cause the apex of detection to shift depending upon covariate levels, making this model incompatible with the point independence assumption when using double-observer data. This paper reports a unimodal detection model based on a two-piece normal distribution that allows covariates, has only one apex, and is consistent with the point independence assumption when double-observer data are utilized. An aerial line-transect survey of black bears in Alaska illustrate how this method can be applied.},

Density and biomass of D. polymorpha increased to a peak in the early 2000s and then declined. In contrast, D. rostriformis bugensis was first found in the southern basin in 2001 and has continued to increase in density or biomass at all depths ever since. In 2008, maximum mean density of D. rostriformis bugensis occurred at 16-30m (19,000/m2), but maximum biomass (AFDW) occurred at 31-50m (43.9g/m2). D. rostriformis bugensis has only recently (since 2005) began to increase at depths {\textgreater}50m. When both species were present in 2004 at depths {\textless}50m, a condition index (CI) for D. rostriformis bugensis was 27{\%} higher, and shell weight per shell length was 48{\%} lower compared to D. polymorpha. For D. rostriformis bugensis, CI decreased in 2008 compared to 2004 at 25m and 45m, but biochemical content (lipid, glycogen) did not. Seasonal changes in both RNA/DNA ratio (growth) and ETS (metabolic activity) in D. rostriformis bugensis were unaffected by reproductive activity, and only ETS appeared to change seasonally relative to bottom temperatures. Spawning of D. rostriformis bugensis occurred in late summer at 25m, but occurred in spring at 45m. Veliger densities peaked in both spring and late summer at both depths.

abstract = {Qualitative sampling is recommended over quantitative sampling when the objective of a mussel survey is to find rare or endangered species. Although advice on how to conduct quadrat surveys is available, there is little information on the influence of sampling effort on the effectiveness of timed searches. We conducted timed searches for mussels at 28 sites on 5 rivers in southwestern Ontario using 4.5 person-hours (p-h) of sampling effort/site. The survey period was divided into 3 equal time intervals, and the number of species and individual mussels collected within each interval were recorded. Increasing the sampling effort dramatically improved the detection of rare species. Sampling for 1.5 p-h, which is the level of effort commonly used in timed search surveys, would have resulted in {\textless}1/2 of the rare species being found and would have underestimated species richness by an average of 37{\%}. Seventy percent of encounters with 3 federally endangered species took place during the 2nd and 3rd time intervals. Increasing the sampling effort from 1.5 to 4.5 p-h/site resulted in all but 2 of the 28 species being found at more sites. Even 4.5 p-h of effort may be insufficient for detecting all species at all sites or estimating species richness for a river. Researchers who rely on qualitative surveys to determine the presence of rare and endangered mussel species should consider the amount of time they spend at their sites because sampling effort can significantly affect their ability to detect these species.},

abstract = {SOME PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF WATERFLOODING Abstract The world's largest potential supply of crude oil exists in the form of residual oil in fields currently being produced by primary methods. Waterflooding can more than double the recoverable reserves of many developed oilfields at low capital investment. Out- standing success has been achieved recently in water- flooding multiple-sand reservoirs in the coastal region of California. These floods indicate that waterfiooding is applicable over a wide range of reservoir conditions. Preliminary evaluation of waterfiood prospects depends upon the ability to predict future performance and economics. Several analytical and empirical methods are available to predict reservoir performance and to design effective water injection programmes for various types of oil reservoirs. Design of water injection programmes involves determination of water injection rates and location of injectors. Water injection rates are based on estimated peak gross production rates with allowance for fluid losses. Location of injectors depends upon the type of waterflood and the design injection rate. Waterflooding introduces new operational problems such as water treatment, corrosion control, water handling, sand production, water-oil ratio control, waste water disposal and hydrogen sulphide problems. These problems add to the cost of waterflood opera- tions but can be solved by early identification, analysis and treatment.

abstract = {Dreissenid mussels (the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha and the quagga mussel D. bugensis) are ecosystem engineers that modify the physical environment by increasing light penetration. Such a change is likely to affect the distribution and diversity of submerged macrophytes. Filter-feeding by these mussels has been associated with increased water clarity in many North American and European lakes. In this study, we report the increase in water clarity of Oneida Lake, New York, USA, for 1975–2002 and argue that the increase was caused by zebra mussel invasion rather than declines in nutrients. Over the study period, although mean total phosphorus decreased significantly, the main increase in water clarity occurred after the zebra mussel invasion in 1991. The average depth receiving 1{\%} surface light increased from 6.7 m to 7.8 m after the invasion of zebra mussels, representing a 23{\%} areal expansion. The maximum depth of macrophyte colonization, as measured by diver and hydroacoustic surveys, increased from 3.0 m before the invasion of zebra mussels to 5.1 m after their establishment. In addition, macrophyte species richness increased, the frequency of occurrence increased for most species, and the composition of the macrophyte community changed from low-light–tolerant species to those tolerating a wide range of light conditions. Comparisons with observations reported in the literature indicate that increased light penetration alone could explain these changes in macrophyte distribution and diversity. Such changes will increase the importance of benthic primary production over pelagic production in the food web, thereby representing an overall alteration of ecosystem function, a process we refer to as “benthification”.},

abstract = {Determination of the relative abundance of two populations, separated by time or space, is of interest in many ecological situations. We focus on two estimators of relative abundance, which assume that the probability that an individual is detected at least once in the survey is either equal or unequal for the two populations. We present three methods for incorporating the collected information into our inference. The first method, proposed previously, is a traditional hypothesis test for evidence that detection probabilities are unequal. However, we feel that, a priori, it is more likely that detection probabilities are actually different; hence, the burden of proof should be shifted, requiring evidence that detection probabilities are practically equivalent. The second method we present, equiva- lence testing, is one approach to doing so. Third, we suggest that model averaging could be used by combining the two estimators according to derived model weights. These dif- fering approaches are applied to a mark–recapture experiment on Nuttall's cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus nuttallii) conducted in central Oregon during 1974 and 1975, which has been previously analyzed by other authors.},

abstract = {* Government agencies develop invasive species management programmes assuming early detection is key to successful management. Some theoretical studies confirm this intuition, while others, which restrict sampling effort to be constant in time, suggest managers are investing too heavily in sampling to detect new local invader populations. * We explore whether these optimal constant-effort strategies underplay the importance of early surveillance and determine how much changing sampling effort through time reduces total management costs. * Using optimal control theory to calculate time-dependent surveillance policies that minimize the total cost of sampling, eradication, and damage by the invasive, we find that the best strategies often use intense early sampling, followed by reduced sampling effort. * Intense early sampling can drastically reduce costs compared with constant-effort strategies if propagule pressure from outside the managed area is low. However, if new infestations arise from frequent independent introductions from an outside source, constant strategies are cost-effective. * Synthesis and applications. For invasive species that are initially present, not frequently reintroduced into the managed area, and for which surveillance is reasonably cost-effective, we recommend a simple three-phase management programme that deploys intense early surveillance until the majority of undetected populations have been discovered, followed by medium effort until most of the heavily infested areas have been cleared of the invader and finally low long-term effort to prevent infestations caused by future introductions and spread from populations that escaped surveillance. This programme captures the majority of the economic benefits from varying sampling effort continuously through time.},

abstract = {The expansion of zebra mussel distribution into inland waterways of North America portends significant abiotic and biotic changes mediated either directly or indirectly by Dreissena. Dreissena fouls a wide array of submerged substrates including rock surfaces, macrophytes, native molluscs, canal and dock walls, and watercraft and motor outdrives. Fouling of water intake pipes and associated installations can severely impair water delivery to hydroelectric, municipal and industrial users, necessitating proactive or reactive control measures. Mussels increase water clarity by removing suspended clay, silt, bacteria, phytoplankton, and small zooplankton. Clear water phases associated with Dreissena grazing may exceed in magnitude and duration those generated by zooplankton grazing. Enhanced water clarity increases light transmittance and growth of benthic plants. Some benthic invertebrates {\{}e.g., unionid molluscs) are adversely affected by Dreissena, whereas others, including amphipod crustaceans, exploit structure associated with or wastes generated by zebra mussels. Dreissena is exploited by a host of predators, most notably waterfowl, fish and crayfish. Waterfowl predators that consume contaminated Dreissena have elevated concentrations of organic pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyl compounds. Invasion of shallow lakes and ponds by Dreissena may divert production and biomass from pelagic to benthic foodwebs, shifting ecosystems to an alternative state.}},

abstract = {Population size and habitat-specific abundance estimates are essential for conservation management. A major impediment to obtaining such estimates is that few statistical models are able to simultaneously account for both spatial variation in abundance and heterogeneity in detection probability, and still be amenable to large-scale applications. The hierarchical distance-sampling model of J. A. Royle, D. K. Dawson, and S. Bates provides a practical solution. Here, we extend this model to estimate habitat-specific abundance and rangewide population size of a bird species of management concern, the Island Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma insularis), which occurs solely on Santa Cruz Island, California, USA. We surveyed 307 randomly selected, 300 m diameter, point locations throughout the 250-km2 island during October 2008 and April 2009. Population size was estimated to be 2267 (95{\%} CI 1613-3007) and 1705 (1212-2369) during the fall and spring respectively, considerably lower than a previously published but statistically problematic estimate of 12 500. This large discrepancy emphasizes the importance of proper survey design and analysis for obtaining reliable information for management decisions. Jays were most abundant in low-elevation chaparral habitat; the detection function depended primarily on the percent cover of chaparral and forest within count circles. Vegetation change on the island has been dramatic in recent decades, due to release from herbivory following the eradication of feral sheep (Ovis aries) from the majority of the island in the mid-1980s. We applied best-fit fall and spring models of habitat-specific jay abundance to a vegetation map from 1985, and estimated the population size of A. insularis was 1400-1500 at that time. The 20-30{\%} increase in the jay population suggests that the species has benefited from the recovery of native vegetation since sheep removal. Nevertheless, this jay's tiny range and small population size make it vulnerable to natural disasters and to habitat alteration related to climate change. Our results demonstrate that hierarchical distance-sampling models hold promise for estimating population size and spatial density variation at large scales. Our statistical methods have been incorporated into the R package unmarked to facilitate their use by animal ecologists, and we provide annotated code in the Supplement.},

Solutions to this smoothing problem tend to be computationally complex, and not to provide model smooth functions which are appropriate for incorporating as components of other models, such as generalized additive models or mixed additive models. We propose a class of smoothers that are appropriate for smoothing over difficult regions of R2 which can be represented in terms of a low rank basis and one or two quadratic penalties. The key features of these smoothers are that they do not `smooth across' boundary features, that their representation in terms of a basis and penalties allows straightforward incorporation as components of generalized additive models, mixed models and other non-standard models, that smoothness selection for these model components is straightforward to accomplish in a computationally efficient manner via generalized cross-validation, Akaike's information criterion or restricted maximum likelihood, for example, and that their low rank means that their use is computationally efficient.},

abstract = {Dreissena polymorpha has been invading fresh waterbodies of eastern and western Europe since the beginning of the 19th century and is still invading. A long history of monitoring and experimental studies conducted in the Former Soviet Union (FSU) has provided us with an understanding of the effects of zebra mussels on waterbodies they invade. However, this work has not been generally available. We review work conducted in the FSU and eastern Europe over the past 60 y on the community effects of this invading species. In freshwater areas, where Dreissena are the only bivalves that attach to hard substrates and have a planktonic larval stage, they can become enormously abundant and, within a short period of time, can obtain a biomass 10 times greater than that of all other native benthic invertebrates. When zebra mussels invade, benthic invertebrate communities change dramatically in terms of total biomass, species composition, and relative abundance of functional groups. Native filter feeders are outcompeted by D. polymorpha and decrease in abundance, while animals feeding on the sediments increase in abundance. Although D. polymorpha can cause a dramatic decline in the abundance of unionids, after initial peaks in zebra mussel abundance, D. polymorpha coexist with unionids. Dreissena are very effective filter feeders and shift materials from the pelagic to the benthos through their filter feeding and deposition of pseudofeces. When zebra mussels invade phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance decreases, the biomass of benthophage fish increases, and a greater percentage of the primary productivity is consumed by higher trophic levels than in systems without zebra mussels.},

abstract = {In less than a decade after being first noticed in 2005, Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) became fully established in Mille Lacs Lake, Minnesota, USA. To explore the ecosystem-wide impact of this invasion in the premier walleye (Sander vitreus) lake, an ecosystem model with 51 functional groups was built using Ecopath and Ecosim (EwE) modelling suite. The model which represents the 1985 ecosystem condition of the lake was tuned to observed time series of fish abundance and fisheries catch data from 1985 to 2006. Zebra mussels were setup with a high initial biomass, and an adequate fishing pressure was applied on it with an aim to neutralize the effect on ecosystem caused by the inclusion of the mussels. At the onset of 2005 (the first year the mussels were observed in the lake), the fishing pressure was released with different trajectories so that we could mimic the non-nutritional challenges the species could have faced during its irruption in the lake. The fitted model was simulated to the year 2036 (30 years). To enhance the credibility of the model prediction, we compared the prediction with the available field data from 2007 to 2012: the model successfully forecasted most of the changes seen in the lake after the period of fitted-data. The simulation results indicated system-wide collapse of major predators including walleye due to the bottom-up trophic control as zebra mussels efficiently filter out the phytoplankton from the system. The result also indicated that the population of zebra mussels in the lake stabilized after attaining the maximum density within few years of the invasion. Furthermore, the model predicted a significant boost in smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui) population when the mussels were incorporated in the diet of crayfish; remarkably, the predatory pressure did not cause a large impact on zebra mussels biomass. Our capability to predict the response of Mille Lacs Lake to zebra mussels invasion would largely depend on the dynamics of plankton groups, the response of juveniles of higher trophic fish species like walleye to the changing dynamics of plankton groups, and the response of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) population-a major prey in the system.},

abstract = {Invasions by nonindigenous species impose large environmental and economic costs. In order to prevent invasions and target monitoring efforts most effectively, we need to forecast locations at the greatest risk of new invasions. To accomplish this, we need to estimate propagule pressure (inoculum size) and consider population processes, including possible Allee effects. Here, we develop a method to estimate the probability of population establishment, based on survival analysis and maximum likelihood techniques. We demonstrate theoretically the validity of this approach, considering environmental heterogeneity, estimation error, and nonlinearity. We then apply this method to zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasions of Michigan inland lakes. We fit our model using presence/absence data for 1589 lakes between 1992 and 1996 and propagule pressure estimates from gravity models of boater traffic. Using our fitted model, we estimated the probabilities of establishment and demonstrated that Allee effects were present in the zebra mussel system. We validated our model using invasion data from 1997–2001 (data not used to parameterize the model). For the validation time period, we correctly predicted up to nine times as many invasions as a null (random) model. Further, the Allee model assigned average probabilities of invasion four times higher for lakes that became invaded than for uninvaded lakes, whereas the non-Allee model predicted probabilities for invaded lakes only two times higher. Thus, our model demonstrates the importance of considering the Allee effect and improves predictions of invasions.},

abstract = {Although point counts are frequently used in ornithological studies, basic as- sumptions about detection probabilities often are untested.We apply a double-observer ap- proach developed to estimate detection probabilities for aerial surveys (Cook and Jacobson 1979) to avian point counts. At each point count, a designated ‘‘primary'' observer indicates to another (‘‘secondary'') observer all birds detected. The secondary observer records all detections of the primary observer as well as any birds not detected by the primary observer. Observers alternate primary and secondary roles during the course of the survey. The ap- proach permits estimation of observer-specific detection probabilities and bird abundance. We developed a set of models that incorporate different assumptions about sources of var- iation (e.g. observer, bird species) in detection probability. Seventeen field trials were con- ducted, and models were fit to the resulting data using program SURVIV. Single-observer point counts generally miss varying proportions of the birds actually present, and observer and bird species were found to be relevant sources of variation in detection probabilities. Overall detection probabilities (probability of being detected by at least one of the two ob- servers) estimated using the double-observer approachwere very high (?0.95), yielding pre- cise estimates of avian abundance.We consider problems with the approach and recommend possible solutions, including restriction of the approach to fixed-radius counts to reduce the effect of variation in the effective radius of detection among various observers and to provide a basis for using spatial sampling to estimate bird abundance on large areas of interest.We believe that most questions meriting the effort required to carry out point counts also merit serious attempts to estimate detection probabilities associated with the counts. The double- observer approach is a method that can be used for this purpose.},

The first is a shipboard line transect survey in the North Sea in which information on measurement error comes from photographically measured distances to a subset of detections. The second is an aerial cue-counting survey off Iceland in which informa- tion on measurement error comes from pairs of independently estimated distances to a subset of detections. Different methods are required for measurement error estima- tion in the two cases. We investigate by simulation the properties of the new estimators and compare them to conventional estimators. They are found to perform better than conventional estimators in the presence of measurement error, more so in the case of cue-counting and point transect estimators than line transect estimators. An appendix on the asymptotic distributions of conditional and full likelihood estimators is available online.},

abstract = {Dreissenid (zebra and quagga) mussels are widely recognized as having strong, adverse ecological and economic impacts, e.g., biofouling and loss of water column primary production. We assessed perceptions and values associated with two less often considered ecological outcomes of dreissenid mussel influences on coastal ecosystems along Lake Ontario and the western St. Lawrence River in New York State. One, the generation of water clarity through filtration, we define as an ecosystem service; the other, the production of large amounts of nuisance algae (e.g., Cladophora and Microcystis) is defined as an ecosystem disservice. Surveys of business owners and homeowners quantified their preferences and the formation of values regarding these products of zebra mussel influence. Water clarity increased greatly, particularly in the eastern portion of Lake Ontario, and algal problems increased throughout. Businesses attributed increases and decreases in revenues associated with water clarity and algae; homeowners reported analogous changes in property values. Water clarity was positively associated, and algae negatively associated, with changes in revenues and property values. Threshold responses of costs as functions of filamentous algae were evident. Given the likely continued influx of invasive species due to human activities, further development of the ecosystem service concept should consider potential "goods" and "bads" of invasives and their influence on ecosystem and social system resiliency. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {* Mark–recapture distance sampling (MRDS) methods are widely used for density and abundance estimation when the conventional DS assumption of certain detection at distance zero fails, as they allow detection at distance zero to be estimated and incorporated into the overall probability of detection to better estimate density and abundance. However, incorporating MR data in DS models raises survey and analysis issues not present in conventional DS. Conversely, incorporating DS assumptions in MR models raises issues not present in conventional MR. As a result, being familiar with either conventional DS methods or conventional MR methods does not on its own put practitioners in good a position to apply MRDS methods appropriately. This study explains the sometimes subtly different varieties of MRDS survey methods and the associated concepts underlying MRDS models. This is done as far as possible without giving mathematical details – in the hope that this will make the key concepts underlying the methods accessible to a wider audience than if we were to present the concepts via equations. * We illustrate use of the two main types of MRDS model by using data collected on two different types of survey: a survey of ungulate faecal pellets where two observers searched independently of each other; and a cetacean survey that used a search protocol that could accommodate responsive movement, with only one observer searching independently and the other being aware of all detections. * Synthesis and applications. Mark–recapture DS is a widely used method for estimating animal density and abundance when detection of animals at distance zero is not certain. Two observer configurations and three statistical models are described, and it is important to choose the most appropriate model for the observer configuration and target species in question. By way of making the methods more accessible to practicing ecologists, we describe the key ideas underlying MRDS methods, the sometimes subtle differences between them, and we illustrate these by applying different kinds of MRDS method to surveys of two different target species using different survey configurations.},

abstract = {1.Distance sampling is a widely used technique for estimating the size or density of biological populations. Many distance sampling designs and most analyses use the software Distance.2.We briefly review distance sampling and its assumptions, outline the history, structure and capabilities of Distance, and provide hints on its use.3.Good survey design is a crucial prerequisite for obtaining reliable results. Distance has a survey design engine, with a built-in geographic information system, that allows properties of different proposed designs to be examined via simulation, and survey plans to be generated.4.A first step in analysis of distance sampling data is modelling the probability of detection. Distance contains three increasingly sophisticated analysis engines for this: conventional distance sampling, which models detection probability as a function of distance from the transect and assumes all objects at zero distance are detected; multiple-covariate distance sampling, which allows covariates in addition to distance; and mark-recapture distance sampling, which relaxes the assumption of certain detection at zero distance.5.All three engines allow estimation of density or abundance, stratified if required, with associated measures of precision calculated either analytically or via the bootstrap.6.Advanced analysis topics covered include the use of multipliers to allow analysis of indirect surveys (such as dung or nest surveys), the density surface modelling analysis engine for spatial and habitat modelling, and information about accessing the analysis engines directly from other software.7.Synthesis and applications. Distance sampling is a key method for producing abundance and density estimates in challenging field conditions. The theory underlying the methods continues to expand to cope with realistic estimation situations. In step with theoretical developments, state-of-the-art software that implements these methods is described that makes the methods accessible to practising ecologists.},

abstract = {Density Surface Models (DSMs) are two-stage models for estimating animal density from line-transect data. First, detectability is estimated by distance sampling, and then a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) is used to estimate animal density as a function of location and/or other spatially-varying environmental covariates. One criticism of DSMs has been that uncertainty from the two stages is not usually propagated correctly into the final variance estimates. Here we show how to reformulate a DSM so that the uncertainty in detection probability from the distance sampling stage (regardless of its complexity) is captured as a random effect in the GAM stage. This allows straightforward computation of the overall variance via standard GAM machinery. We further extend the formulation to allow for spatial variation in group size, which can be an important covariate for detectability. We illustrate these models using line transect survey data of minke whales and harbour porpoise from the SCANS-II survey in northern Europe.},

Our results suggest that much of the American West will be uninhabitable for zebra mussels. Nonetheless, some catchments along the West Coast and in the southeastern United States exhibit considerable risk of invasion and should be monitored carefully.

abstract = {A primary objective of ecological monitoring programs typically includes the efficient detection of population trends. Passerines as a group are important ecological indicators and are often included in such programs to provide information on multiple species with a single survey technique. However, commonly used field and analytical approaches may not provide appropriate inference or sensitivity due to assumption violations and differences in the proportion of the population exposed to sampling. Recent methodological developments utilizing repeated point counts and an N-mixture modeling approach for analysis may produce more consistent and interpretable estimates applicable to the superpopulation of individuals using a site during the breeding season. These estimates should be more useful for monitoring because they are not conditioned on presence or availability as are most single-visit approaches. We used repeated count data collected in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska (Denali) between 1995 and 2009 from 12 common passerine species to assess variation in presence and availability throughout the season, estimate trends in superpopulation abundance, and provide recommendations for the design of future monitoring programs. We found that variation in detection due to presence and availability was large and differed among species. After accounting for these sources of variation, we estimated abundance of Wilson's warblers (Wilsonia pusilla) had declined by approximately 48{\%} and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) abundance had increased by approximately 250{\%} over 15. years. Combined, our results suggest that if trend estimation is a priority, passerine monitoring programs should formally address all components of the detection process, including the probabilities of presence and availability. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Therefore, it is important to understand properties of the point process distribution. We examine how the hierarchical species distribution modeling framework has been used to incorporate a wide array of regression and theory-based components while accounting for the data collection process and making use of auxiliary information. The hierarchical modeling framework allows us to demonstrate how several commonly used species distribution models can be derived from the point process distribution, highlight areas of potential overlap between different models, and suggest areas where further research is needed.},

abstract = {Mark-recapture models applied to double-observer distance sampling data neglect the information on relative detectability of objects contained in the distribution of observed distances. A difference between the observed distribution and that predicted by the mark-recapture model is symptomatic of a failure of the assumption of zero correlation between detection probabilities implicit in the mark-recapture model. We develop a mark-recapture-based model that uses the observed distribution to relax this assumption to zero correlation at only one distance. We demonstrate its usefulness in coping with unmodeled heterogeneity using data from an aerial survey of crabeater seals in the Antarctic.},

abstract = {The globalization of economies and trade have facilitated the spread of exotic species including the five most important freshwater suspension feeding invaders Dreissena polymor- pha, D. bugensis, Corbicula fluminea, C. flumnalis, and Limnoperna fortunei. We suggest that the spread of these exotic species has not been a continuous process, but rather punctuated by periods of rapid long distance spread (jump), during which species greatly expanded their geo- graphic ranges. Each jump has been associated with changes in the tempo of some human activ- ity, such as the construction of shipping canals for trade, building of reservoirs for water storage and power production, political boundary changes or changes in political systems, which affected the position or permeability of national borders, hu- man migration, changes in the mode and volume of international trade, or recent industrial prac- tices and environmental laws. We hypothesize that the rate of spread of exotic species depends on the spatial scale of spread and may be accel- erated or slowed by various human activities. In general, aquatic exotic species may quickly spread along connected waterways in a new continent they invade and soon reach their maximum range (continental scale). However, it will take much longer to colonize all isolated regions (regional scale) and longer still to spread to all isolated lakes and river systems (local scale). The differ- ence in the rate of colonization across scales may be several orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {* Knowledge of species distribution is critical to ecological management and conservation biology. Effective management requires the detection of populations, which can sometimes be at low densities and is usually based on visual detection and counting. * Recently, there has been considerable interest in the detection of short species-specific environmental DNA (eDNA) fragments to allow aquatic species monitoring within different environments due to the potential of greater sensitivity over traditional survey methods which can be time-consuming and costly. * Environmental DNA analysis is increasingly being used in the detection of rare or invasive species and has also been applied to eDNA persistence studies and estimations of species biomass and distribution. When combined with next-generation sequencing methods, it has been demonstrated that entire faunas can be identified. * Different environments require different sampling methodologies, but there remain areas where laboratory methodologies could be standardized to allow results to be compared across studies. * Synthesis and applications. We review recently published studies that use eDNA to monitor aquatic populations, discuss the methodologies used and the application of eDNA analysis as a survey tool in ecology. We include innovative ideas for how eDNA can be used for conservation and management citing test cases, for instance, the potential for on-site analyses, including the application of eDNA analysis to carbon nanotube platforms or laser transmission spectroscopy to facilitate rapid on-site detections. The use of eDNA monitoring is already being adopted in the UK for ecological surveys.},

abstract = {Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) invaded the Great Lakes in 1986 and are considered to be a nuisance species, because of their rapid population growth and their strong byssal attachment to a variety of man-made and natural surfaces. Research on possible antifouling materials or coatings has revealed few nontoxic substrates that even retard attachment of mussels. The influence of several substrate characteristics in combination (material, texture, orientation, and sunlight) on zebra mussel settlement was examined. Settlement of post-veliger mussels on experimental plates indicated that the mussels attached in higher numbers on upper versus lower horizontal surfaces, textured versus smooth surfaces, shaded versus sunlit surfaces, PVC versus Plexiglas, and plastic (PVC and Plexiglas) versus glass. Zebra mussels did not show strong preferences among several additional substrate materials (wood, Fiberglas, concrete, limestone, aluminum, and raw steel) but they strongly avoided galvanized steel. These results confirm field observations of locations in which mussels are most likely to be found. Information about zebra mussel substrate preferences may enhance the design of monitoring programs and the integrated management of mussels in vulnerable areas. $\backslash$n},

abstract = {Dissolved oxygen (DO) declines have serious implications for the health of aquatic systems. These declines ari often attributed to changes in organic or nutrient loading but are not generally attributed to species invasions. We use an Ii-year record of DO in the tidal Hudson River to describe the timing and spatial extent of the DO decline as compared to the timing and spatial extent of the zebra mussel establishment in the river. Furthermore, the system attributes that interact with zebra mussel respiration to moderate DO declines are explored using physical and biological budgets. Concurrent with the establishment of the zebra mussel, mean summertime DO declined from 8.3 to 7.3 mg L-1. Because of moderate hydrologic inputs and atmospheric exchange, system respiration would have to increase by only about 0.5 g of O-2 m(-2) d(-1) to have caused this decline. Independently estimated zebra mussel respiration (1.1 g of O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) is about double this required respiration. Increased macrophyte photosynthesis, due to increased light penetration after the zebra mussel invasion, may have moderated the effect of zebra mussels on DO.},

Conservation and management efforts will benefit from rapid, inexpensive, and accurate on-site methods to detect harmful aquatic species to prevent their introduction and spread.

Specifically, eDNA filtering and extraction methods were used to isolate DNA from: (1) lake water samples that were seeded with a microscopic fragment of five high-risk invasive species and (2) untreated samples from lakes infested with the invasive zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. LTS was then used to detect size shifts resulting from hybridization of PCR products with nanobeads covered with species-specific oligonucleotide probes. The results demonstrate that coupling eDNA sampling with LTS species detection can provide a sensitive and real-time solution for screening real-world water samples for invasive species.},

abstract = {Point-count surveys are often used to collect data on the abundance and distribution of birds, generally as an index of relative abundance. Valid com- parison of these indices assumes that the detection process is comparable over space and time. These restrictive assumptions can be eliminated by estimating detection probabilities directly. We generalize a recently proposed removal model for estimat- ing detection probabilities using a time-of-detection approach, which can account for more sources of variation in point-count data. This method is speciBcally designed to account for variation in detection probabilities associated with singing rates of birds. Our model accounts for both availability bias and detection bias by modeling the combined probability that a bird sings during the count, and the prob- ability that it is detected given that it sings. The model requires dividing the count into several intervals and recording detections of individual birds in each interval. We develop maximum-likelihood estimators for this approach and provide a full suite of models based on capture-recapture models, including covariate models. We present two examples of this method: one for four species of songbirds surveyed in Great Smoky Mountains National Park using three unequal intervals, and one for the Pearly-eyed Thrasher (Margarops fuscatus) surveyed in Puerto Rico using four equal intervals. Models incorporating individual heterogeneity were selected for all data sets using information-theoretic model-selection techniques. Detection probabilities varied among count-time intervals, which suggests that birds may be responding to observers. We recommend applying this method to surveys with four or more equal intervals to reduce assumptions and to take full advantage of stan- dard capture-recapture software. The time-of-detection approach provides a better understanding of the detection process, especially when singing rates of individual birds affect detection probabilities.},

However, little research has been done to categorize the numerous examples of mobile learning in the context of distance education, and few instructional design guidelines based on a solid theoretical framework for mobile learning exist. In this paper I compare mobile learning (m-learning) with electronic learning (e-learning) and ubiquitous learning (u-learning) and describe the technological attributes and pedagogical affordances of mobile learning presented in previous studies. I modify transactional distance (TD) theory and adopt it as a relevant theoretical framework for mobile learning in distance education. Furthermore, I attempt to position previous studies into four types of mobile learning: 1) high transactional distance socialized m-learning, 2) high transactional distance individualized m-learning, 3) low transactional distance socialized m- learning and 4) low transactional distance individualized m-learning. As a result, this paper can be used by instructional designers of open and distance learning to learn about the concepts of mobile learning and how mobile technologies can be incorporated into their teaching and learning more effectively.},

abstract = {Freshwater mussels appear to be promising candidates for adaptive cluster sampling because they are benthic macroinvertebrates that cluster spatially and are frequently found at low densities. We applied adaptive cluster sampling to estimate density of freshwater mussels at 24 sites along the Cacapon River, WV, where a preliminary timed search indicated that mussels were present at low density. Adaptive cluster sampling increased yield of individual mussels and detection of uncommon species; however, it did not improve precision of density estimates. Because finding uncommon species, collecting individuals of those species, and estimating their densities are important conservation activities, additional research is warranted on application of adaptive cluster sampling to freshwater mussels. However, at this time we do not recommend routine application of adaptive cluster sampling to freshwater mussel populations. The ultimate, and currently unanswered, question is how to tell when adaptive cluster sampling should be used, i.e., when is a population sufficiently rare and clustered for adaptive cluster sampling to be efficient and practical? A cost-effective procedure needs to be developed to identify biological populations for which adaptive cluster sampling is appropriate.},

abstract = {Distance-sampling methods are commonly used in studies of animal populations to estimate population density. A common objective of such studies is to evaluate the relationship between abundance or density and covariates that describe animal habitat or other environmental influences. However, little attention has been focused on methods of modeling abundance covariate effects in conventional distance-sampling models. In this paper we propose a distance-sampling model that accommodates covariate effects on abun- dance. The model is based on specification of the distance-sampling likelihood at the level of the sample unit in terms of local abundance (for each sampling unit). This model is augmented with a Poisson regression model for local abundance that is parameterized in terms of available covariates. Maximum-likelihood estimation of detection and density parameters is based on the integrated likelihood, wherein local abundance is removed from the likelihood by integration. We provide an example using avian point-transect data of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) collected using a distance-sampling protocol and two measures of habitat structure (understory cover and basal area of overstory trees). The model yields a sensible description (positive effect of understory cover, negative effect on basal area) of the relationship between habitat and Ovenbird density that can be used to evaluate the effects of habitat management on Ovenbird populations.},

abstract = {We study the coverage properties of Bayesian confidence intervals for the smooth component functions of generalized additive models (GAMs) represented using any penalized regression spline approach. The intervals are the usual generalization of the intervals first proposed by Wahba and Silverman in 1983 and 1985, respectively, to the GAM component context. We present simulation evidence showing these intervals have close to nominal ‘across-the-function' frequentist coverage probabilities, except when the truth is close to a straight line/plane function. We extend the argument introduced by Nychka in 1988 for univariate smoothing splines to explain these results. The theoretical argument suggests that close to nominal coverage probabilities can be achieved, provided that heavy oversmoothing is avoided, so that the bias is not too large a proportion of the sampling variability. Otherwise, because the Bayesian intervals account for bias and variance, the coverage probabilities are surprisingly insensitive to the exact choice of smoothing parameter. The theoretical results allow us to derive alternative intervals from a purely frequentist point of view, and to explain the impact that the neglect of smoothing parameter variability has on confidence interval performance. They also suggest switching the target of inference for component-wise intervals away from smooth components in the space of the GAM identifiability constraints. Instead intervals should be produced for each function as if only the other model terms were subject to identifiability constraints. If this is done then coverage probabilities are improved.},

In this setting, the prop- erties of the animal abundance estimator stem from the sampling scheme adopted to locate transects or points on the study region, as well as from the modeled detection probabilities. Moreover, the abundance estimation can be viewed as a “generalized” version of Monte Carlo integration. This approach permits to prove the superiority of the stratified placement of transects or points (based on a regular tessellation of the study region) over the uniform random placement. Even if the result was already established for the fixed-area sampling, i.e., when a perfect detection takes place, it was lacking in distance sampling.

abstract = {This paper discusses a general framework for smoothing parameter estimation for models with regular likelihoods constructed in terms of unknown smooth functions of covariates. Gaussian random effects and parametric terms may also be present. By construction the method is numerically stable and convergent, and enables smoothing parameter uncertainty to be quantified. The latter enables us to fix a well known problem with AIC for such models. The smooth functions are represented by reduced rank spline like smoothers, with associated quadratic penalties measuring function smoothness. Model estimation is by penalized likelihood maximization, where the smoothing parameters controlling the extent of penalization are estimated by Laplace approximate marginal likelihood. The methods cover, for example, generalized additive models for non-exponential family responses (for example beta, ordered categorical, scaled t distribution, negative binomial and Tweedie distributions), generalized additive models for location scale and shape (for example two stage zero inflation models, and Gaussian location-scale models), Cox proportional hazards models and multivariate additive models. The framework reduces the implementation of new model classes to the coding of some standard derivatives of the log likelihood.},

To analyze the data, we developed a hierarchical model that allowed us to assess variation in detection probabilities among observers and survey dates, as well as account for variation in crocodile abundance among sites and habitats. We conducted surveys from July 2008-June 2009 in 15 areas of Lake Nasser that were representative of 3 main habitat categories. During these surveys, we sampled 1,086 km of lake shore wherein we detected 386 crocodiles. Analysis of the data revealed significant variability in both inter- and intra-observer detection probabilities. Our raw encounter rate was 0.355 crocodiles/km. When we accounted for observer effects and habitat, we estimated a surface population abundance of 2,581 (2,239-2,987, 95{\%} credible intervals) crocodiles in Lake Nasser. Our results underscore the importance of well-trained, experienced monitoring personnel in order to decrease heterogeneity in intra-observer detection probability and to better detect changes in the population based on survey indices.

abstract = {A common objective when surveying freshwater mussels is to detect the presence of rare populations. In certain situations, such as when endangered or threatened species are potentially in the area of a proposed impact, the survey should be designed to ensure a high probability of detecting species presence. Linking survey design to probability of detecting species presence has been done for quantitative surveys, but commonly applied designs that are based on timed searches have not made that connection. I propose a semiquantitative survey design that links search area and search efficiency to probability of detecting species presence. The survey can be designed to protect against failing to detect populations above a threshold abundance (or density). I illustrate the design for surveys to detect clubshell (Pluerobema clava) and northern riffleshell (Epioblasma torulosa rangiana) in the Allegheny River. Monte Carlo simulation indicated that the proposed survey design performs well under a range of spatial distributions and low densities (,0.05 m 2) where search area is sufficient to ensure that the probability of detecting species presence is predicted to be !0.85.},

Of the ten benthic invertebrate groups identified prior to invasion (1980–81), only densities of Diporeia and Oligochaeta have changed since the appearance of the zebra mussel, and only Diporeia and Chironomidae changed in relative abundance. These changes are similar to those observed in other areas of the Great Lakes, with the exception of an increase in Oligochaeta density. Post-invasion (2002–03) shallow-water communities appear to be more homogeneous, dominated by zebra mussels and Isopoda, whereas deep-water sites are more heterogeneous due to the loss of Diporeia. Additional data on Diporeia density for several years between 1959 and 2004 indicated that current low densities are not typical of South Bay. Based on changes in the benthic communities and published literature on whitefish diets, we predict that unless whitefish are able to switch to Mysis as an alternative to Diporeia, post-inva-sion whitefish diets will only contain a maximum of 57 to 84{\%} of their former energy content. These pre-dictions are likely underestimates, as they do not take into account increased energy costs associated with reductions in total invertebrate density at historical foraging depths.},

abstract = {Mark-recapture distance sampling is a promising method for surveying bird populations from aircraft in open landscapes. However, commonly available distance sampling estimators require that distances to target animals are made without error and that animals are stationary while sampling is being conducted. Motivated by a recent bird survey where these requirements were routinely violated, we describe a marginal likelihood framework for estimating abundance from double-observer data that can accommodate movement and measurement error when observations are made consecutively (as with front and rear observers), when animals are uniformly distributed during detection by the first observer, and when detections consist of both moving and stationary animals. Assuming that all animals are subject to measurement error and that some animals can move between detections, we integrate over unknown animal locations to construct a marginal likelihood for detection, movement, and measurement error parameters. Estimates of animal abundance are then obtained using a modified Horvitz–Thompson-like estimator. In addition, unmodelled heterogeneity in detection probability can be accommodated through observer dependence parameters. Using simulation, we show that our approach yields low bias compared to approaches that ignore movement and/or measurement error, including in cases where there is considerable detection heterogeneity. Applying our approach to data from a double-observer waterfowl helicopter survey in northern Canada, we are able to estimate bird density accounting for movement and measurement error and corrected for observer heterogeneity. Our approach appears promising for generating unbiased estimates of bird abundance necessary for reliable conservation and management.},

abstract = {Double-observer line transect methods are becoming increasingly widespread, especially for the estimation of marine mammal abundance from aerial and shipboard surveys when detection of animals on the line is uncertain. The resulting data supplement conventional distance sampling data with two-sample mark-recapture data. Like conventional mark-recapture data, these have inherent problems for estimating abundance in the presence of heterogeneity. Unlike conventional mark-recapture methods, line transect methods use knowledge of the distribution of a covariate, which affects detection probability (namely, distance from the transect line) in inference. This knowledge can be used to diagnose unmodeled heterogeneity in the mark-recapture component of the data. By modeling the covariance in detection probabilities with distance, we show how the estimation problem can be formulated in terms of different levels of independence. At one extreme, full independence is assumed, as in the Petersen estimator (which does not use distance data); at the other extreme, independence only occurs in the limit as detection probability tends to one. Between the two extremes, there is a range of models, including those currently in common use, which have intermediate levels of independence. We show how this framework can be used to provide more reliable analysis of double-observer line transect data. We test the methods by simulation, and by analysis of a dataset for which true abundance is known. We illustrate the approach through analysis of minke whale sightings data from the North Sea and adjacent waters.},

abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling has proven to be a valuable tool for detecting species in aquatic ecosystems. Within this rapidly evolving field, a promising application is the ability to obtain quantitative estimates of relative species abundance based on eDNA concentration rather than traditionally labor-intensive methods. We investigated the relationship between eDNA concentration and arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) abundance in five well-studied natural lakes, and additionally, we examined the effects of different temporal (e.g., season) and spatial (e.g., depth) scales on eDNA concentration. Concentrations of eDNA were linearly correlated with char population estimates (〖"R " 〗{\_}"adj" {\^{}}"2" = 0.78) and exponentially correlated with char densities (〖"R " 〗{\_}"adj" {\^{}}"2" = 0.96 by area; 0.82 by volume). Across lakes, eDNA concentrations were greater and more homogeneous in the water column during mixis; however, when stratified, eDNA concentrations were greater in the hypolimnion. Overall, our findings d...},

abstract = {Modern coexistence theory and contemporary niche theory represent parallel frameworks for understanding the niche's role in species coexistence. Despite increasing prominence and shared goals, their compatibility and complementarity have received little attention. This paucity of overlap not only presents an obstacle to newcomers to the field, but it also precludes further conceptual advances at their interface. Here, we present a synthetic treatment of the two frameworks. We review their main concepts and explore their theoretical and empirical relationship, focusing on how the resource supply ratio, impact niche, and requirement niche of contemporary niche theory translate into the stabilizing and equalizing processes of modern coexistence theory. We show for a general consumer-resource model that varying resource supply ratios reflects an equalizing process; varying impact niche overlap reflects a stabilizing process; and varying requirement niche overlap may be both stabilizing and equalizing, but has no qualitative effect on coexistence. These generalisations provide mechanistic insight into modern coexistence theory, while also clarifying the role of contemporary niche theory's impacts and requirements in mediating coexistence. From an empirical perspective, we recommend a hierarchical approach, in which quantification of the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is used to guide more focused investigation into the underlying niche factors determining species coexistence. Future research that considers alternative assumptions, including different forms of species interaction, spatio-temporal heterogeneity, and priority effects, would facilitate a more complete synthesis of the two frameworks.},

abstract = {The early detection of disease epidemics reduces the chance of successful introductions into new locales, minimizes the number of infections, and reduces the financial impact. We develop a framework to determine the optimal sampling strategy for disease detection in zoonotic host-vector epidemiological systems when a disease goes from below detectable levels to an epidemic. We find that if the time of disease introduction is known then the optimal sampling strategy can switch abruptly between sampling only from the vector population to sampling only from the host population. We also construct time-independent optimal sampling strategies when conducting periodic sampling that can involve sampling both the host and the vector populations simultaneously. Both time-dependent and -independent solutions can be useful for sampling design, depending on whether the time of introduction of the disease is known or not. We illustrate the approach with West Nile virus, a globally-spreading zoonotic arbovirus. Though our analytical results are based on a linearization of the dynamical systems, the sampling rules appear robust over a wide range of parameter space when compared to nonlinear simulation models. Our results suggest some simple rules that can be used by practitioners when developing surveillance programs. These rules require knowledge of transition rates between epidemiological compartments, which population was initially infected, and of the cost per sample for serological tests.},
