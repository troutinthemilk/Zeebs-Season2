Title: Density estimation tutorial for zebra mussel survey methods
Description: We describe how to analyze data collected using dependent double-observer surveys with and without distance sampling. These designs are sometimes refered to as "removal designs" (rather than dependent double-observer designs). Here we show how to use design-based estimators of density.
